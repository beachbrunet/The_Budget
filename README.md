# The Budget

A budget tracker application that gives isers a fast and easy way to track their money, having offline functionality.

## Requirements

<!-- ----------------------- -->

```
If you choose to accept your mission....
Giving users a fast and easy way to track their money is important, but allowing them to access that information anytime is even more important. Having offline functionality is paramount to our applications success.

AS AN avid traveller I WANT to be able to track my withdrawals and deposits.
Ofcourse with or without a data/internet connection SO THAT my account balance is accurate when I am traveling.

GIVEN a user is on Budget App without an internet connection WHEN the user inputs a withdrawal or deposit THEN that will be shown on the page, and added to their transaction history when their connection is back online.
